# Bath Pixel Bot

A robot that likes pixels. It lives in Bath and looks for local pixels to share.

By sharing the pixels it finds, the robot hopes to help demonstrate the interesting pictures and photographs that humans make near where it lives.

Sometimes the robot looks for new pixels. Sometimes it looks for interesting or not so interesting pixels. Variety makes it interesting.
